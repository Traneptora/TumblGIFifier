# TumblGIFifier
Automatically Creates GIFs from Videos sized to Tumblr's liking.
Tumblr has a maximum GIF size of 2.0 MB, and TumblGIFifier will automatically resize it as close as it can to that threshold.

The main website and description for TumblGIFifier is at the Github Pages page: [https://thebombzen.com/TumblGIFifier/](https://thebombzen.com/TumblGIFifier/)

**Warning:**
TumblGIFifier is still in its early stages of development. The UI is a bit clunky and there *WILL* be undiscovered bugs.

## Instructions

See [https://thebombzen.com/TumblGIFifier/](https://thebombzen.com/TumblGIFifier/) for details.

## Issues

Submit a bug report or pull request here to submit bugs/patches. Alternatively, you could go to #tumblgififier on freenode, where I'll be around to answer questions.

## Known Problems

- The user interface is somewhat unintuitive, with the text explanation right next to the controls and weird word wrap.
- There's no "how to use" instructions. I need to add a help window explaining the features.
- If you nudge the sliders very quickly sometimes the screenshots will come up in the wrong order.
