			<p>
				<p>TumblGIFifier is a Java program that automatically creates GIFs from videos sized to <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>'s liking. <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> has a maximum GIF size of 2.0 MB, and TumblGIFifier will automatically resize it as close as it can to that threshold.</p>
				<p>The current release of TumblGIFifier is <b>0.6.0</b>. All releases will be marked as "pre-releases" until version 1.0.0, when TumblGIFifier is production-ready. At this moment it is not. TumblGIFifier is still in its early stages of development, the UI is a bit clunky, and there <i>WILL</i> be undiscovered bugs.</p>

			<div class="section-header">Downloading and Running</div>
			<p>
				<p>TumblGIFifier is hosted at Github, at <a href="https://github.com/thebombzen/TumblGIFifier">https://github.com/thebombzen/TumblGIFifier</a>.</p>
				<p>To download the most recent version of the program, go to the <a href="https://github.com/thebombzen/TumblGIFifier/releases">releases page</a>. Download the most recent release, which should be at the top. There will be several downloads - download the JAR file, not the zips containing the source code.</p>
				<p>TumblGIFifier comes as an executable JAR file. You need to have at least Java 1.7 to run it. If you don't have java installed, download it <a href="http://java.com/">here</a> and install it.</p>
				<p><ul>
					<li>To execute the JAR file on Windows, doubleclicking it should work as long as you have Java installed. However, some archive programs might try to open it as an archive. If so, open it with the Java Platform (and you should probably set the Java Platform as the default for opening JAR files anyway).</li>
					<li>To execute the JAR file on a Mac, you need to open it with JAR Launcher. If you try to open it using the default way you might accidentally unzip it and barf a bunch of files all over your desktop. Try not to do that.</li>
					<li>To execute the JAR file on Linux, you really don't need me to finish this sentence.</li>
				</ul></p>

				<p>TumblGIFifier is based of <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>. If the program finds <code>ffmpeg</code>, <code>ffprobe</code>, and <code>ffplay</code> in your path, it will use those.

TumblGIFifier will also download the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans Semibold</a> font and use it for the purpose of overlaying text.
